			   ARGUMENT PASSING
			   ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

		char *fn_copy;
			//to store a copy of the filename

		char ** arr = (char **)(malloc(sizeof(char *) * len));
			//to store the input 

		tid_t tid;
			//thread id
		
		char * token  
			// Token

		char * save_ptr 
			// Pointer to next token

		int argc
			// number of arg being processed (counter)

		static bool setup_stack (void **esp, char *init_name) 
			// change to take the filename


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

		I took the input and split them from ' ' using strtok_r and assigned the filename to token to create the thread.  
		After that I took the original input and split them into a string array. Then I copied those separated strings 
		in to the stack in the given order in the setup_stack() function. Since I do not know the exact size of the
		arguments, I gave it an initial value using malloc() and check if the size is not enough for all the arguments 
		in a for loop. If it is not enough I realloc() the array to double its size. So that it can handle any size of args.

		

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

		strtok_r() requires the position of the next token. 
		Because of that strtok_r is said to be thread safe (avoiding race condition)
		and because of the tokens it can be used in nested loops.


>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this

		UNIX approach restricts user from passing bad arguments to kernel.
		Kernal does not need to deal with the parsing procedure.

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

		File descriptors are unique for each open file per process. 
		Each process has the only file descriptor counter that is incremented by 
 		each time a file is opened. 
		Because of that, the file descriptor is unique within a single process.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

		First I check whether the stack pointer is valid using ptr_validator() 
		method. If so, I check system call that has to run. (read or write)
		
		After that I take all arguments for that system call.
		Now I check the whether the buffer is valid using buf_validator() 
		method. If so, execute the system call according to their type (read(), write())

		//answer do not know


>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

		The system call "wait" invokes process wait, 
		which uses a while loop to wait for child processes to quit, 
		using sentinel as the child process exit member variable.

		 I have introduced a function named ptr_validator which will validate 
		 the pointer  by checking  is_user_vaddr. If it is not system will exit(-1).
		 I also introduced a function to validate strings (str_validator()) to
		 look up the page that it is in. To handle buffers I build buf_validator() function.
		 It will validate all the pointers one by one using the function ptr_validator().



---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

		I keep the status in the child_process struct. I check the status if 
		it is loaded or not using procss_id. If not then exit with -1. (exit(-1))


>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

		If P is waiting for C, P will stop and wait for C to finish. 
		When C finishes it will exit() and the lock is released. 
		If P wants to wait after C finishes, P will not wait because there are no child processes. 
		If P exits before C exits, P kills all children, including C. Then all children will be finished and unlocked. 
		When P finishes after C exits, C will be unlocked.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

		I use function decomposition for error catching. 
		It reduces the difficulty and is more simpler to implement.
		When a pointer is invalid, it will be caught by the page fault interrupt
  		handler. Then the exit(-1) function will be called.


>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

		advantage:
			It eleminates the possibility of occuring a race conditions. 


>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

		I did not change
